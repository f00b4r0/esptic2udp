# esptic2udp

Implementation of [tic2json](http://hacks.slashdirt.org/sw/tic2json/) for ESP8266/ESP32.
Gets TIC data on RX pin, sends formatted JSON over UDP.

## Usage

### Configure the project

`idf.py menuconfig`

* Under Component config -> esptic2udp, set the following:
  * UART for receiving TIC frames and TIC baudrate
  * Optional GPIO number for LED heartbeat and LED active state
  * Optional GPIO number for TIC2UART enable and enable active state
  * Target UDP host and port
* Under Component config -> simple_network, configure as needed
* Under Component config -> tic2json, set TIC version and adjust options as needed
* Under Component config - > Common ESP-related, it is advised to move the console IO to a different UART than the one used by this app

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board:

`idf.py flash`

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

Tested working on ESP8266 and ESP32.

### Connect

Use e.g. [TIC2UART](http://hacks.slashdirt.org/hw/tic2uart/) or [TICESP](http://hacks.slashdirt.org/hw/ticesp/) to connect the TIC output of the meter to the RX pin of your ESP board.
